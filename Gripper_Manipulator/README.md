This assignment deals with ROS Services. 

A manipulator is used to follow a particular trajectory. 

The name of the service is /execute_trajectory provided by the iri_wam_reproduce_trajectory package, and the client node (.py file) sends a request to carry out the service

The service is following a trajectory to do a certain task, which is the "get_food.txt" file in the .py file which the program accesses while running. 

There are many .txt files such as release_food.txt, initial_pose.txt, etc. (All provided by the Construct)
